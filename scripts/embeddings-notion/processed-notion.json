  "Cooking an egg is a simple yet versatile culinary skill that can be mastered by anyone. To prepare a delicious egg, start by heating a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add a small amount of butter or oil to the pan. Once the fat is heated, crack the egg gently and let it slide into the pan. For a perfect sunny-side-up egg, cook it until the whites are set, but the yolk remains runny. If you prefer an over-easy egg, carefully flip it and cook for a few seconds on the other side. Salt and pepper to taste, and serve on toast or alongside other breakfast favorites. Enjoy your delectable creation!",
